### Machine Learning
Supervised models for regression (linear regression, neural networks) and classification (decision trees, CNNs).  
Unsupervised approaches such as dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoders).  

ðŸ”— [My implementation in C++](https://github.com/NicolaAdrah/Machine_Learning_CPP) Â·  
ðŸ”— [Deep Learning Practice](https://github.com/NicolaAdrah/deep_learning_python) Â·  
ðŸ”— [Course Project](https://github.com/aredjil/Temperature-forecasting-for-different-cities-in-the-world/tree/main) with *Dr. Serafina Di Gioia*
