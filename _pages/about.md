I am currently working on **oceanographic modeling of open boundary conditions** using **Julia**, particularly with the `Oceananigans.jl` library, at **OGS/SISSA**, **Trieste**, **Italy**.

I am also a **PhD candidate at the University of Trieste**, where my research will focus on applying **artificial intelligence to High Energy Physics**, with a special emphasis on **conformal field theory**.
